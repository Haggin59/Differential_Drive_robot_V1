# Differential_Drive_robot_V1

Building a differential drive robot based on Arduino Uno


Components:
1. Robot Chasis
2. Arduino UNO
3. LM393 wheel encoder  x2
4. DC Motors            x2
5. Wheels               x2

The plan is to build an autonomous differential drive robot, that could map its location (position and orientation) on its work environment
using encoder readings and differential drive Kinematics. Additional features may be added as the build progresses.
